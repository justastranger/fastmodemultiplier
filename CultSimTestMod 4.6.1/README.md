# fastmodemultiplier
This was probably the simplest first thing I figured I could make with BepInEx. All it does it create a config file that allows you to increase the rate of time.

# Installation
Extract `fastmodemultiplier.dll` to your `Cultist Simulator\BepInEx\plugins` folder.

# Usage
Open `Cultist Simulator\BepInEx\config\justastranger.fastmodemultiplier.cfg` in your favorite text editor.
Find the line that says `Multiplier = 1` and change that 1 to whatever value you want that's greater than or equal to 1.
